This document has the tutorials for the Code Assess project.

1. Welcome
Welcome to the Code Assess! This platform allows teachers to track student progress in MartyBlocks.
There are 5 main pillars of programming that we evaluate the students on:
- Algorithms
- Analysis
- Decomposition
- Generalization and Abstraction
- Pattern Recognition and Data Representation

Press the "Next" button to read more about these pillars.

2. Algorithms
Algorithms are a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem. They are the building blocks of programming. We evaulate the algorithms based on the following criteria:
- Conditional statement used, such as if, else, or repeat
- Operators used, such as +, -, >, <, or ==
- Synchronization and Messages such as broadcasting or waiting for a message

3. Analysis
Analysis is the degree to which the student understands the problem and the solution. We evaluate the analysis based on the following criteria:
- Use of comments to explain the code
- Naming of variables and functions to make the code readable
- Using debugging tools to find and fix errors

4. Decomposition
Decomposition is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. We evaluate the decomposition based on the following criteria:
- Use of functions to break down the problem
- When events that make the code run in parallel are used
- When events that change the code's sequence are used

5. Generalization and Abstraction
Generalization is the process of creating generalized solutions that apply to multiple scenarios, while abstraction involves simplifying complex realities by modeling only the necessary aspects. We evaluate the generalization and abstraction based on the following criteria:
- Use of variables to store values
- Use of functions to make the code more reusable

6. Pattern Recognition and Data Representation
Pattern recognition is the process of identifying patterns and regularities in data, and data representation involves the methods and structures used to store and organize data in a way that is efficient for processing and analysis. We evaluate the pattern recognition and data representation based on the following criteria: (data types, loops, VariablesAndDataStructures)
- Use of various data types such as numbers, strings, and boolean values
- Use of loops to repeat a set of instructions
- Use of variables operations and data structures such as lists

7. Teacher Overview Tab
The teacher Overview tab allows teachers to see an overview of the students' progress in MartyBlocks. It includes a table that contains information about the students' progress so far. 


8. Teacher Progress Table
The Progress Table shows the students' progress in the 5 main pillars of programming. The columns of that table represent the names of the students (beside the 1st column that represents the Class Average), while the rows of the column depend on the selected table mode. The table modes are:
- All Sessions (default)
- Last Session
